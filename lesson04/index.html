    <p class="text">In an interview, talking about what 'your greatest weakness' or flaw is difficult. We're here to make it easier.
        Today, I want to talk about one of the most common and aggravating interview questions of them all: What is your
        greatest weakness?<br>
        'Are you rolling your eyes?' Most candidates hate this question and consider it pointless. After all, they
        aren't about
        to confess candidly to their biggest flaws in the middle of a job interview. <br>
        However, this question has become a clich√© for a reason. Interviewers continue to ask it even though they know
        they are
        unlikely to get answers that are 100% honest <br>
        Why? Because the way you answer a question about your weaknesses is very telling. You may not even realize what
        you are
        communicating when you answer this question. <br>
        And let's face it, you're 'probably doing it wrong'. Most people do. I say that as an interview coach who has
        now worked
        with thousands of job seekers. At least 90% of my clients need help with answering the 'weakness' question.</p>
